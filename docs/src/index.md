<p>
This package provides a high-performance implementation of the Material Point Method (MPM) in <a href="https://julialang.org" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaLang/julia-logo-graphics/master/images/julia.ico" width="16em"> Julia Language</a>. Currently, we are focusing on the run-out processes of landslides, there are two built-in schemes, i.e., one-phase single-point MPM and two-phase single-point MPM, but users also can create/modify their own update schemes by using this package.

While primarily focused on GPU(s) performance, extensive tests show MPMSolver.jl also delivers notable CPU efficiency, often faster than MATLAB's vectorized implementations. It's crucial to recognize that CPUs' limited threading may reduce performance when using synchronization methods like atomic or spin locks without modifing the MPM algorithm or data structure. Therefore, for peak CPU performance, using a single-thread mode is recommended.
